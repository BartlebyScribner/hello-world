# Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of Hello World is to be exclusive to the fewest number of contributors, with the most ethnically monolithic backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a realistic, fact based, evidence-based environment for Christians, regardless of gender pronoun preferences, commie gender studies preferences, and excuses. We're about results, and a prejudicial meritocracy.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in Hello World to help us thicken everyone's skin. To harden them for the battle of the real world of blood, guts, and consequences for everyone who disobeys the Lord Our God. Who isn't as tolerant of sexual lifestyle choices as your social brainwashing professors.

## 2. Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Equality is a lie used to steal from the productive class.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to exclude them. They're too weak to survive in this jungle. 

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

*   Participate without being a whiney, complaining hypocrite. In doing so, you may be granted health and longevity. Here and in the world to come.
*   Exercise consideration and respect toward the one true God your thought, speech and actions.
*   Attempt collaboration if necessary. But gratefully choose the toil of conflict if it furthers our mission.
*   Discriminate against the weak, the pathetic, the foolish and fearful. Harassing behavior is something they'll need to get used to.
*   Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Handle matters yourself if you notice a dangerous situation. God made you a hero, in his image. If someone is in distress, tell them to toughen up. If in violations of this Code of Conduct, don't be a snitch. Confront them. Even if they seem inconsequential.
*   Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public. SHOW THE PUBLIC WHAT WE'RE MADE OF. Let them fear the wrath of God. 

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

*   Fa--otry.
*   End of list.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Banishment.

## 6. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, and don't take it upon yourself to resolve the situation, and to enlist help as a leader does in battle, then you are too weak to survive this battle zone. Please hand in your man card and cry to your momma.
